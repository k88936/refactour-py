There are two places to explore available refactoring actions in the %IDE_NAME%: the **Refactor This**
and **Search Everywhere** dialogs.

### Refactor This

To invoke refactoring in %IDE_NAME%;, select an item to refactor (a variable, method, class, package, etc.)
and press **&shortcut:Refactorings.QuickListPopupAction;** to open a
list of
refactorings that can be applied.
You can also use a shortcut to invoke specific refactoring.

It is possible to undo any refactoring by pressing **&shortcut:$Undo;**.

### Search Everywhere

If you want to refactor some code and are unfamiliar with the IDE’s refactorings shortcuts, you can open the **Search
Everywhere** dialog and type the name of the action you would like to perform.

To open the **Search Everywhere** dialog, press **Shift+Shift**.

For example, if you want to extract a function or explore any extract possibilities in the IDE,
open the **Search Everywhere** dialog, type “Extract”, and it will show the available options.

Moreover, for some refactorings, %IDE_NAME% allows users to see the preview before applying changes.
It could be useful if you are not sure how refactoring changes would affect your code and want to make sure that it
would work as you expect.
